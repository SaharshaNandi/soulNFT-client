# ABOUT
Our [deployment](https://soulnft.vercel.app/) lets users create a dynamic NFT which will expire after a period of time specified by the user. Users will need to have [Metamask Wallet](https://metamask.io/download/) installed in their browsers to pay for gas fees assosciated with the transactions. All deployments are on [Ethereum Rinkeby Testnet](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/) at this point of time and users must switch the network in their Metamask wallets before interacting with the website. Credentials for testing:- login id: roy@gmail.com, password: marcelom12

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
